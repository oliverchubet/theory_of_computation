\noindent \startchapter{Foundations of Computation} is a textbook for a one semester introductory course
in theoretical computer science.  It includes topics from discrete mathematics,
automata theory, formal language theory, and the theory of computation, along with
practical applications to computer science. It has no prerequisites other than a
general familiarity with computer programming.  Version 2.3, Summer 2010, was a minor 
update from Version 2.2, which was published in Fall 2006.  Version 2.3.1 is an even
smaller update of Version 2.3.  Version 2.3.2 is identical to Version 2.3.1 except for
a change in the license under which the book is released.
