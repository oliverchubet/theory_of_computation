\problem Let $\Sigma=\{a\}$.  Draw a transition diagram for a Turing
machine that computes the function $f\colon\Sigma^*\to\Sigma^*$ where
$f(a^n)=a^{3n}$, for $n\in\N$. Draw a transition diagram for a Turing
machine that computes the function $f\colon\Sigma^*\to\Sigma^*$ where
$f(a^n)=a^{3n+1}$, for $n\in\N$.

\problem Let $\Sigma=\{a,b\}$.
Draw a transition diagram for a Turing machine that
computes the function $f\colon\Sigma^*\to\Sigma^*$ where
$f(w)=w^R$.

\problem Suppose that $\Sigma$, $\Gamma$, and $\Xi$ are alphabets and that
$f\colon\Sigma^*\to\Gamma^*$ and $g\colon\Gamma^*\to\Xi^*$ are 
Turing-computable functions.  Show that $g\circ f$ is Turing-computable.

\problem We have defined computability for functions $f\colon\Sigma^*\to\Gamma^*$,
where $\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$ are alphabets.  How could Turing machines
be used to define computable functions from $\N$ to $\N\,$?
(Hint: Consider the alphabet $\Sigma=\{a\}$.)

\problem Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet and let $L$ be a language over $\Sigma$.
Show that $L$ is Turing-decidable if and only if its complement,
$\overline{L}$, is Turing-decidable.

\problem Draw a transition diagram for a Turing machine which
decides the language $\{a^nb^n\st n\in\N\}$.  (Hint: Change the
$a$'s and $b$'s to \$'s in pairs.)  Explain in general terms how to
make a Turing machine that decides the language $\{a^nb^nc^n\st n\in\N\}$.

\problem Draw a transition diagram for a Turing machine which
decides the language $\{a^nb^m\st n>0$ and $m$ is a multiple of $n\}$.
(Hint: Erase $n$ $b$'s at a time.)

\problem Based on your answer to the previous problem and the copying
machine presented in this section, describe in
general terms how you would build a Turing machine to decide the
language $\{a^p\st p$ is a prime number$\}$.

\problem Let $g\colon \{a\}^*\to\{0,1\}^*$ be the function such that
for each $n\in\N$, $g(a^n)$ is the representation of $n$ as a binary
number.  Draw a transition diagram for a Turing machine that computes $g$.
